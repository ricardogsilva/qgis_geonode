The plugin will eventually be made available to the general QGIS audience by being released onto the official plugins repository.

It is used to perform all operations related to the plugin: Install the plugin to your local QGIS user profile Ensure your virtual env has access to the QGIS Python bindings Build a zip of the plugin etc. It is run inside the virtual environment created by poetry. As such it must be invoked like this: # get an overview of existing commands poetry run python pluginadmin.py --help Install plugin into your local QGIS python plugins directory \u00b6 When developing, in order to try out the plugin locally you need to call poetry run python pluginadmin.py install command. This command will copy all files into your local QGIS python plugins directory. Upon making changes to the code you will need to call this installation command again and potentially also restart QGIS. Note Restarting QGIS is necessary because this plugin adds an additional data source provider to QGIS and there is currently no way to reload the available providers without restarting QGIS. poetry run python pluginadmin.py install Running tests \u00b6 Tests are made with pytest and pytest-qt . In order to be able to run the tests, the Python virtual environment needs to have the QGIS Python bindings available. This can be achieved by running: Note If your QGIS is in a non-standard location, you can set these env variables before running the command: - `PYQT5_DIR_PATH` - location of PyQt5. Defaults to `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5` - `SIP_DIR_PATH` - Location of the SIP package. Defaults to `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` - `QGIS_PYTHON_DIR_PATH` - Location of the QGIS Python bindings. Defaults to `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/qgis` poetry run python pluginadmin.py install-qgis-into-venv Installing QGIS Python bindings into the Python virtual environment only needs to be done once. Finally, run tests with: poetry run pytest Contributing \u00b6 We welcome contributions from everybody but ask that the following process be adhered to: Find (or open) the issue that describes the problem that you want to help solving. Make a mention in the issue that you are working on a solution Fork this repo and work on a solution to the problem. Remember to add passing automated tests to attest that the problem has been fixed Run your code through the black formatter before submitting your PR. Otherwise the CI pipeline may fail, and we will request that you fix it before merging.

New versions shall be released under the semantic versioning contract. In order to have a new version of the plugin release: Be sure to have updated the CHANGELOG.md Be sure to have updated the version on the pyproject.toml file. You can either manually modify the tool.poetry.version key or you can run the poetry version {version specifier} command Create a new git annotated tag and push it to the repository. The tag name must follow the v{major}.{minor}.{patch} convention, for example: git tag -a -m 'version 0.3.2' v0.3.2 git push origin v0.3.2 Github actions will take it from there.
